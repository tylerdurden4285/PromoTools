# PromoTools
Windows batch command based video editing tool that uses ffmpeg options to shortcut video promotions, screenshots and watermarks. Must be installed in C drive to work. 

#How To Use:

You unzip this to your C:/ drive on windows computer. You drop your video onto the "PromoTools.bat" file and it will open a windows command line with options. Allow it time to process. At the end it will tell you where in the "/output" directory you can find your end results media and it will let you go back to the start menu to do more. Close manually when done. 

This is my first real program, sorry if there's any issues. It works for me. If you have troubles try installing "ffmpeg" on your windows computer".
